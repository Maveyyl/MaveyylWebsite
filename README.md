* polynomial regression page needs some explanation text and decent layout
* Bug with x inputs for polynomial regression page: can only tip one character and then focus on the input is lost
* Children views' template file are currently on the same level, refactor to have them under a folder. Refactor views' name that have children views.
* Refactor views template name to include "view" at the end so that we have room to name the content component and templates
